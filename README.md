## Working

## Screen -1

- We'll using `antd` design in our application ,

-  Starting with `formLayout.tsx` which gather the *companyName* and *TIckerName* from the user.

- which is sent via `post` request via axios to the app.py api

- where the api fetches the relevant news using `newsapi` , `util_requests.py` handles the fetching of *Quarterly Reports* and they are all send back to the front-end as json response.

- After the successful completion of the `post` request , UI is switched to `Dashboard.tsx`

## Screen -2

- With tabmodes , one for the `newsapi` and another for the `Quarterly reports`

- which is switchable anyway

- Onclicking the listItem on the *Quarterly reports* , modal will be shown with a `iframe` pointing the original page ( htttp://sev.gov.data ,  which seems to be not working because the security reasons )
